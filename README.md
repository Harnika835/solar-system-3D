##  Features Implemented

-> Sun at the center of the scene  
-> All 8 planets orbiting around the Sun  
-> Each planet rotates around the Sun with default speed  
-> Realistic 3D lighting and camera setup  
-> **Orbit speed controls** (sliders) for each planet  
-> **Pause/Resume animation** button  
-> **Tooltip/label on hover** showing the planet name  
-> **Starry background** for visual depth  
-> Mobile-responsive design

##  How to Run

1. **Download or clone** the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. You will see:
   - A 3D solar system with orbiting planets.
   - Sliders on the left to control each planet’s orbit speed.
   - A "Pause/Resume" button on the top right.
   - Planet names appear as tooltips when you hover.

- Works across desktop and modern mobile browsers.
- All objects (planets, sun, stars) are built using Three.js primitives.
